# BTV E10 Technical Reference

---

## Overview

### Device Description
The **BTV E10** (often referred to as BTV E10 Express) is a commercial Android TV Box manufactured by BTV. It was originally distributed as an entertainment receiver for streaming channels, media, and gaming applications.

### Intended Market
Primarily targeted at the consumer entertainment and media streaming market in Latin America, especially Brazil. Due to hardware obsolescence or service desupport, thousands of these devices are currently discarded, decommissioned, or seized, making them excellent candidates for hardware recycling and conversion into server edge nodes.

### Current Known Hardware Status
The BTV E10 is built on a stable, robust Amlogic G12A-based architecture. The default factory configuration features a quad-core processor, a dedicated graphics processor, eMMC storage, and standard connectivity peripherals (USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Fast Ethernet).

### MultiForge Support Status
* **Status**: 🟢 Fully Supported (as of Phase 1 MVP)
* **Target Architecture**: `arm64` (ARMv8-A)
* **Primary Image**: Educabox / Armbian (customized kernel `6.1.y`)
* **Deployment Profile**: Headless Server, IoT Gateway, or Media Station (Kodi)

## Flashing

### Method 1: SD Card / USB Drive Boot (Recommended for Installation)
* **Requirements**: USB Flash Drive or MicroSD card (minimum 8GB), BalenaEtcher/Rufus, customized scripts (`aml_autoscript`, `s905_autoscript`).
* **Procedure**:
  1. Burn the image (e.g. `Armbian-S905x2-BTV-DOACAO-2023.img`) using BalenaEtcher.
  2. Place custom `aml_autoscript` and `s905_autoscript` on the root of the boot partition.
  3. Copy `meson-g12a-sei510.dtb` into `/dtb/amlogic/`.
  4. Hold the reset button (inside the AV jack) with a toothpick/clip and power on the box.
* **Risks**: Extremely low. Does not overwrite the internal eMMC unless explicitly commanded.
* **Support Status**: 🟢 Fully Operational.

### Method 2: U-Boot Script Conversion to eMMC
* **Requirements**: Established boot via external USB/SD Card, target script `/root/install-aml.sh`.
* **Procedure**:
  1. Boot into the live environment.
  2. Run the script `\root\install-aml.sh` (or `install-aml.sh`).
  3. Change the boot target uuid inside `armbianEnv.txt` to point to the new `BOOT_EMMC` partition.
* **Risks**: High. Overwrites the factory Android OS. Can cause soft-bricks if interrupted.
* **Support Status**: 🟢 Supported.

### Method 3: USB Burning Tool (Recovery)
* **Requirements**: Windows PC, Amlogic USB Burning Tool (v2.x or v3.x), male-to-male USB Type-A cable connected to the USB 2.0 port.
* **Procedure**:
  1. Load the factory `.img` firmware inside the software.
  2. Press the reset button inside the AV jack and connect the USB cable.
  3. Start flashing.
* **Risks**: Moderate.
* **Support Status**: 🟢 Supported.

## Recovery

### Soft-Brick Recovery
If the device fails to boot but shows life (LED lights, serial output), it can be recovered by flashing the factory Android image via the **Amlogic USB Burning Tool** using a male-to-male USB cable.

### Hard-Brick Recovery (MaskROM Mode)
If the bootloader is completely corrupted, the SoC can be forced into MaskROM mode:
1. Open the casing to expose the PCB.
2. Locate the eMMC clock (CLK) and Ground (GND) test pads on the board.
3. Short-circuit these two pads using tweezers while inserting the power cord/USB cable.
4. The device will report to the host PC as a generic Amlogic USB device, allowing a fresh U-Boot upload.

## Teardown Analysis

### Teardown Reference Video
The primary teardown and software conversion documentation is sourced from the academic research video by the Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP): [Procedimento para conversão TVBox BTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAo_zRkePls).

### Internal Layout and Casing
* **Casing**: Constructed of ABS plastic held together with plastic tabs. There are no external screws holding the top and bottom covers.
* **Opening**: Requires a plastic spudger or guitar pick inserted into the seam between the top and bottom covers to pop the retaining clips.
* **Thermal System**: A small aluminum passive radiator sits on top of the Amlogic SoC. A thermal pad fills the gap between the chip package and the heatsink. 
* **Engineering Observations**: The board uses a relatively clean design with dedicated ESD protection chips around the HDMI port. The reset button is co-located inside the 3.5mm AV port, requiring a non-conductive toothpick or plastic pin to actuate.

## Known Issues

> [!WARNING]
> **Amlogic Incompatibility with armbian-install**: 
> Standard Armbian configurations rely on the `armbian-install` script to flash images to internal storage. However, TV Boxes with Amlogic SoCs (including the S905X2 inside the BTV E10) **are incompatible** with this script. Attempting to run it will corrupt the partition table. Instead, users **must** utilize the specialized `install-aml.sh` script.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Built-in Bluetooth**: 
> The Wi-Fi chip (RTL8189FTV) does not contain a Bluetooth controller. USB Bluetooth dongles must be used if Bluetooth peripherals are required.

## MultiForge Notes

### Representation in ForgeDB
* **SoC Verification**: Mainline config must target **Amlogic S905X2** with high confidence. The Rockchip RK3566 entry found in older catalog indexes is a conflict and should be treated as an unverified/incorrect specification for the BTV E10.
* **Default DTB Config**: The device must be provisioned with `fdtfile=amlogic/meson-g12a-sei510.dtb` in the configuration files.
* **Auto-Detection Profile**:
  ```yaml
  detection:
    cpu_info: "Amlogic"
    hardware: "g12a"
    revision: "BTVE E10-LPDDR4 V.10"
  ```
